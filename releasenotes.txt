Working on:
  Planning for further development, feature request are welcome, could be:
	Executing scripts, open scripts in "editor / runner", saving scripts  
	Sort data / query results by clicking on title
	Data editing form use editing button at each row
	Data entry - add post from option menu in table browser
	Implement some of SQLites .commands:
	  .read FILENAME		execute SQL from file
	  .import FILE TABLE	import data from file to table
	  .output FILENAME		send output to file
	  .dump ?TABLE?			dump database / table, a supplement to export
